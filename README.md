# Confusion Matrix Visualization

Different ways to visualize confusion matrix

In machine learning a confusion matrix is a kind of a table that is used to understand how well our classification model predictions perform, typically a supervised learning. It helps us a lot in understanding the model behaviour and interpreting the results.  

In this project we will not discuss how to interpret a confusion matrix, that could be find [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix). Instead, we will present several ways of how to visualize a confusion matrix.

Some of the topics covered in the [notebook](https://github.com/zunicd/Confusion-Matrix-Visualization/blob/main/Confusion%20Matrix%20Visualization.ipynb):  

- normalized vs. unnormalized matrix
- confusion matrix arrays 
- confusion matrix dataframes, side by side
- plotting:
  - single confusion matrix heatmap
  - unnormalized and normalized heatmaps, side by side
  - multiple (two and more) confusion matrices, in two columns
